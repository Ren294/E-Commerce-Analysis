# System Architecture

The **Data Lakehouse** architecture implemented in this project is meticulously designed to accommodate both batch and real-time streaming data, seamlessly integrating multiple data sources into a cohesive analytics platform. This architecture follows the `Medallion Architecture` pattern, which organizes data into **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold layers**, each serving specific roles in the data lifecycle. 

## System Overview

The system is divided into several components, each responsible for specific tasks within the data process:

  <center>
      <img src="image/Architecture.png" width="1200" />
  </center>

## Data Sources

The architecture brings together structured and unstructured data from several key sources:

### 1. PostgreSQL Databases:

- **Ecom Database**: Contains structured data related to customer information, orders, product details, reviews, sellers, and transactions. This database reflects the transactional core of the e-commerce platform.

- **Marketing Database**: Contains marketing-related data, particularly focused on Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), helping to track the effectiveness of marketing efforts and the progression of leads through the funnel.

### 2. Log-Based Data:

- **Ecommerce Clickstream Transactions**: This dataset captures user interactions with the e-commerce platform, such as clicks, views, and purchases. It reflects customer behavior in real-time, making it essential for analyzing user engagement and optimizing the shopping experience.

- **Access Log E-Commerce**: Server logs that provide metadata about user activity, requests, and system performance. This log-based data is critical for tracking the health and uptime of the platform.

## Data Processing Layers
The system processes data in distinct layers, each serving a different purpose in the overall workflow.

### 1. Batch Layer

- **Ingestion**: Structured data from `PostgreSQL` databases (Ecom and Marketing) is ingested into the **Bronze layer** of the *Data Lakehouse* using `Sqoop`, scheduled through `Apache Airflow` for regular updates. This ensures that fresh data is continuously available for processing.

- **Transformation**: Once ingested into the **Bronze layer**, the data is processed by `Apache Spark` to clean, enrich, and transform it into more structured formats. This refined data is then stored in the **Silver layer** of the *Data Lakehouse*.

- **Storage**: The transformed data is stored in `HDFS` in the **Silver layer** as `Parquet` files, providing an efficient storage format for analytics. The data is then further processed and written to the **Gold layer**, which utilizes `Delta Lake` and `Hive` for highly structured, query-optimized data. This layer is designed for high performance in analytical queries and is the final stage of batch processing.

### 2. Streaming Layer
- **Real-Time Ingestion**: Streaming data from *ecommerce_clickstream_transactions* and *access_log_ecommerce* is ingested into the system using `Apache NiFi` and published to `Kafka` topics.

- **Real-Time Processing**: `Apache Spark Streaming` consumes the Kafka topics and processes the data in near real-time, cleaning and enriching it before publishing it to new `Kafka` topics. These processed streams are then ingested by `NiFi` and stored in `Cassandra` for quick retrieval and further analysis.

- **Monitoring**: Processed real-time data is stored in `Cassandra` and `HDFS Silver` for quick retrieval and analysis. Logs from `Spark Streaming` jobs are monitored using `Filebeat` and `Logstash`, with logs being sent to `Elasticsearch` for detailed log analysis and visualizations through `Kibana`. `Redpanda`â€™s built-in monitoring tools help track Kafka topic health, consumer lag, message throughput, and latency, ensuring that the streaming layer remains performant and reliable.

## Storage Layer
The storage layer follows a **Bronze-Silver-Gold** tiered model, where data transitions from raw to refined as it moves through the pipeline:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw, unprocessed data from various sources, such as `PostgreSQL` and log files, is stored in `HDFS`. This is the initial ingestion layer, where data is kept in its original form.

- **Silver Layer**: Here, processed and cleaned data is stored as `Parquet` files in `HDFS`. This layer is tailored for analytics and machine learning, providing a refined dataset for querying and model building.

- **Gold Layer**: The Gold layer features highly optimized and structured data, utilizing `Delta Lake` and `Hive`. This layer is designed for high performance and efficient querying, making it ideal for reporting and business intelligence tools such as `Power BI`.


## Analytics and Reporting

- **Data Science**: `Spark MLlib` is used in conjunction with Jupyter Notebook for advanced analytics and machine learning. Data scientists can access data from the Silver layer to build predictive models, analyze customer behavior, and generate insights into product recommendations, churn predictions, and more.

- **Business Intelligence**: `Power BI` is employed to visualize data from the **Gold layer**. Business users can create dynamic dashboards and reports, providing insights into sales performance, customer segmentation, marketing effectiveness, and operational metrics.

## Monitoring and Logging
A comprehensive monitoring and logging system is integrated into the architecture to ensure the smooth operation of data pipelines and processing jobs.

- **Grafana**: Monitors system metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage of the Docker containers hosting various components.
  
- **Elastic Stack (Filebeat, Logstash, Kibana)**: Logs from `Spark` jobs are collected using `Filebeat`, passed through `Logstash` for processing, and indexed into `Elasticsearch`. `Kibana` is used to visualize these logs, providing insights into job performance, system errors, and resource utilization.
  
- **Docker**: The entire architecture is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling. Monitoring of the `Docker containers` is managed, which tracks CPU, memory, and resource usage for each container.
  
- **Apache Airflow UI** is used for scheduling and monitoring batch jobs. The `Airflow UI` allows visualization of `DAGs` (Directed Acyclic Graphs), tracking job statuses, scheduling intervals, and monitoring task failures or successes.

# Data Warehouse Architecture in the Gold Layer

    </center>

- **Task Monitoring**: Click on a DAG to view the individual tasks within that workflow. You can check:
  - **Task status**: Green for success, red for failure, yellow for in progress.
  - **Task duration**: Helps in identifying bottlenecks.
  - **Logs**: For each task, detailed logs are available for debugging.

- **Topic Management**: You can create, delete, or configure Kafka topics directly from the console.

### 3. Monitoring Data Flow Processors with NiFi Web UI

Apache NiFi manages the flow of data through various sources and sinks in real-time. The `NiFi Web UI` provides an intuitive interface to monitor and manage data flows.

- **Open NiFi Web UI**: Navigate to http://localhost:8443/nifi to access the NiFi dashboard (introduced in [Configure and Run Apache NiFi](#Configure-and-Run-Apache-NiFi)).
  
- **Processor Status**: View each processor's status to see if itâ€™s running, stopped, or encountering errors.
  
- **Data Provenance**: This feature allows you to trace the lifecycle of any data passing through the NiFi flow. Itâ€™s useful for debugging data anomalies.
  
- **Back Pressure**: Monitor back pressure on queues to ensure data is being processed without delay. If back pressure is high, `NiFi` might need tuning or resource adjustments.

### 4. Monitoring Spark Streaming with Kibana

`Spark Streaming` processes real-time data and logs can be visualized and monitored using `Kibana`, a part of the **ELK Stack** (`Elasticsearch`, `Logstash`, `Kibana`).

- **Access Kibana**: Open the `Kibana` dashboard by navigating to http://localhost:5601 (introduced in [Configure and Visualization with Kibana](#Visualization-with-Kibana)).
  
- **Create Index Pattern**: Create an index pattern to pull data from `Elasticsearch`, where `Spark` logs are stored.
  
- **Dashboards**: Use pre-built or custom dashboards to monitor `Spark Streaming` job status. Look for:
  
  - **Job execution time**s: To identify slow tasks or jobs.
    
  - **Error logs**: Filter logs to find any failures or errors in `Spark` jobs.
    
  - **Log Search**: Use `Kibana`â€™s search functionality to filter logs by time, job ID, or error type, helping to diagnose issues.

### 5. Monitoring Docker Containers with Docker Desktop

- All components (`Airflow`, `Kafka`, `NiFi`, `Spark`, `Cassandra`, etc.) are running in `Docker` containers. Docker Desktop provides a central platform to monitor the health and performance of all containers.
  
  - **Open Docker Desktop**: You can monitor the status of each container running in the environment from `Docker Desktop`.
    
  - **Container Health**: Check if any container is unhealthy, stopped, or restarting frequently. Each containerâ€™s resource usage (CPU, memory, and network I/O) can also be monitored.
    
  - **Logs**: Access real-time logs of any container to diagnose errors or failures. Logs can also be streamed to external monitoring systems like `ELK` for deeper analysis.
    
  - **Resource Management**: `Docker Desktop` provides an overview of how much CPU, RAM, and disk space each container is using. This helps in managing system resources efficiently.
